# everforest-walls

**Note:** The wallpapers in this collection are made with the old palette (i.e. the palette before [this change](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest/commit/c7d3ffec0a4725c5154c824f0d036fa26a40232a)) in mind. I do not intend on using the new palette; I think it looks too much like Gruvbox, so I will stick to the old palette.

Collection of wallpapers I recolored to the [Everforest colorscheme](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest)
